\section*{Introduction}

The aim of this report is to detail the derivation and testing of a model of a
simple cart system via a linear least squares based system identification.  The
cart system to be identified is a simple system involving a cart driven by a
voltage $V$.  

To simplify the system the overall force on the cart is modeled as a
proportional constant $\left(\overline\beta\right)$ relating the voltage to the
force provided by the DC motor and gears along with a simple second order
damping term $\left(\overline{C}\right)$; along with the normal Newton's second
law of motion for the acceleration.  This results in a pair of equations
describing the system:

\begin{equation}
F\left(t\right) = \bar\beta V - \bar{C} \dot{y} \qquad M_C \, \ddot{y} = F\left(t\right)
\end{equation}

By rearranging and simplifying these equations we can get a single second order
equation describing the system:

\begin{equation}
\ddot{y} = \beta V - C \dot{y}
\end{equation}

where $\beta = \frac{\bar\beta}{M_C}$ and $C = \frac{\bar{C}}{M_C}$.
