\section*{Introduction}

The aim of this report is to detail the derivation and testing of a model of a
simple cart system via a linear least squares based system identification.  The
cart system to be identified is a simple system involving a cart driven by a
voltage $V$.  

To simplify the system the overall force on the cart is modeled as a
proportional constant $\left(\overline\beta\right)$ relating the voltage to the
force provided by the DC motor and gears along with a simple second order
damping term $\left(\overline{C}\right)$; along with the normal Newton's second
law of motion for the acceleration.  This results in a pair of equations
describing the system:

\begin{equation}
F\left(t\right) = \bar\beta V - \bar{C} \dot{y} \qquad M_C \, \ddot{y} = F\left(t\right)
\end{equation}.

By rearranging and simplifying these equations we can get a single second order
equation describing the system:

\begin{equation}
\ddot{y} = \beta V - C \dot{y}
\end{equation}, 

where $\beta = \frac{\bar\beta}{M_C}$ and $C = \frac{\bar{C}}{M_C}$.

The controller used on the system was a proportional controller with an input
signal of $r\left(t\right) = 0.06 \sin\left(\omega t\right)$.  This gives an
overall system of:

\begin{equation}
\ddot{y} + C \dot{y} + \beta K_p y = \beta K_p r\left(t\right)
\end{equation}, 

where $K_p = 60$.

A frequency response experiment for this system was run for a range of 12
frequencies, 0.6--2.8 Hz with a step of 0.2.

By re-writing the system with $K = \beta K_p$ and $\bar{K} = 0.06 \beta K_p$ the
analytical solution was found to be:

\begin{equation}
y_\text{model} = A_1 \cos\left(\omega t\right) + A_2 \sin\left(\omega t\right)
\end{equation}, 

where, 

\begin{equation}
A_1 = - \frac{\bar{K} C \omega}{C^2 \omega^2 + \omega^4 - 2 \omega^2 K + K^2}
\end{equation},

and,

\begin{equation}
A_2 = \frac{\bar{K} \left(\omega^2 - K\right)}{C^2 \omega^2 + \omega^4 - 2 \omega^2 K + K^2}
\end{equation}
